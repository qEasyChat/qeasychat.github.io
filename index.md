# qEasyChat
An open source communication solution.

# Client
Do you want a communication client that has an **intuitive** and **user friendly** graphical interface? Or you are loving the terminal and you want a console-line interface? Our solution covers both use cases. You can communicate with your friends, even if they are not using the same client!

# Server
Do you wish to host your own server? All you need is to download our easy to use server application. 

# For developers
Do you wish to create a similar app or one that is using this system of communication? You can use our API. You have access to our communication protocol, client and server backend so you can integrate this application into your own infrastructure.
